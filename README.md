# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Multiple Games

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A code that lets you play different games.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will let the user input the name of one of the games they want to play and play it . It will be executed on Love2d.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

1 Game

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

2 Games

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

3 or more games

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to code using Lua because we spent the entire semester learning Python, now I have to learn a new coding language to build the software.
